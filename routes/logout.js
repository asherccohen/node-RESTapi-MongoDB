The logout endpoint is not needed.
The act of logging out can solely be done through the client side.
A token is usually kept in a cookie or the browserâ€™ s localstorage.
Logging out is as simple as destroying the token on the client.
This /logout endpoint is created to logically depict what happens when you log out.
The token gets set to null. */
